During the years following the end of World War II, German architects seemed content to follow the style inspired by Mies van der Rohe and the great American architectural teams, a style that threatened to attain the status of an academic requirement. This prediction, however, has proved wrong. In the 1960's, the decade with which this book is concerned, a reaction to the architectonic idealism of the preceding period took place. Building became increasingly plastic, appealing not only to the eye but to the tactile senses as well.
