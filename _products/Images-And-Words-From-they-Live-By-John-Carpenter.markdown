Zürich-based designer Piero Glina celebrates the 25th anniversary of John Carpenter’s satirical science fiction horror film, ‘They Live’ (1988), with the release of a two-volume publication. It includes an exact replica of a magazine prop as seen in the original film that contains the same iconic typography spelling out propagandistic quotations coined by a ruling class of concealed aliens, which have also since entered the lexicon of popular culture: “cooperate”, “consume”, “reward indifference”, “do not question authority”, “no thought”, and more. The second volume is comprised of stills from the cult classic that show the scenes where the words appear in the film.
