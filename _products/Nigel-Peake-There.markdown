Nigel Peake produces meticulous hand-drawn maps and obsessively detailed pencil illustrations. Architecture plays a prominent role in his work, as is also the case with ‘There’, the result of his spending a month in an apartment in Paris while working on a series of drawings. There he soon found another drawing project when looking outside the apartment’s windows, a yard that was in fact inaccessible to him. The yard was always devoid of people, so he began to draw it using blue pencil. Each picture is a fragment of the whole, interpretations and perspectives that can be pieced together, interchanged, or float freely without context. The book includes a twelve-page insert with texts.<br>
