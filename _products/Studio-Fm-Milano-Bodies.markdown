In this book is a collection of pictographs made by studio FM milano, a graphic design studio founded in 1996 by Barbara Forni, Cristiano Bottino, and Sergio Menichelli. Each one is essentially a fragment of more complex and articulated projects. Presented in this way, they take on a life of their own, becoming characters independent of the design contexts in which they were created. The subjects are ordered randomly, or in relation to simple visual similarities or pictorial graphic systems, and only two colours (purple and green) are used. It is simultaneously a monograph and a manifesto that expresses the essence of the studioâ€™s output over its two decades of work.
